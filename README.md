# To-Do-List
This is a multi-page website where users can sign up, log in, log out, and create to-do lists to manage their tasks.
Users can keep track of their tasks by adding new tasks, deleting, editing, sorting, and arranging tasks.
Users can create different lists for different sets of tasks and move tasks between different lists. The task can be marked as done, in progress, or archived. Tasks can be sorted by name or due date. The due date, task name, and task description can be changed at any time.
The server, implemented in Node.js, is responsible for responding to usersâ€™ requests and allowing users to navigate between different pages.
